Project Progress after Workshop 1

First step:
Brainstorm some ideas for the first lab. In Lab 1, we will finalize groups, and discuss project ideas. By Lab 2, you should have selected a project topic.

Project Requirements:
Must be completed with your group before workshop 2
 
●        Let TAs know who your group members are (we will do some icebreaker exercises today)
●        Must have a repo in github which all group members can access and send us the link on slack. (See instructions “How to hand in” below.) DONE!!
○       In order to create a repo, you will need to decide on a project name BARK!
●        Project Description: Write 3-5 sentences on your project topic. (try to address all points below)
○       Who is it for? There are 2 use cases: (1) For Pet owners that cannot easily access a veterinarian office and seek an alternative to bringing their animal in person. (2) For vets to continue to see their animal patients/take on new patients virtually. Especially important now during covid times.
○       What will it do? (What "human activity" will it support?) It will connect veterinarians and pet owners given their situation(location, time, urgency, specialty, etc.). It will allow them to interact via video conference and messaging. There will also be a pre-screening chatbox to ascertain level of urgency and provide vet with initial notes about their patient.
○       What type of data will it store? It will store profile data(name, address, pictures, description, etc) It will store messages from tread. It will store history in the form of prescription, pictures, remedies, etc.
○       What will users be able to do with this data?
Pet owners will be able to retrieve old messages from their vets and prescriptions/pictures. Vets will be able to retrieve old messages from patients and have a message log/history to reference for old patients. 
○       What is some additional functionality you can add/remove based on time constraints? We can add functionalities such chat bot, video conferencing, messaging, map API, schedule API, 
●        Project task requirements:
○       3-5 minimal requirements (will definitely complete)
Home page displaying menu option(login, sign-in, search)
Sign-in form for users to create a profile
Create a profile as vet or
Create profile as patient
Login page for users to access their account
Search page for users to find the right clinic/vets to select patient

○       3-7 "standard" requirements (will most likely complete)
Video conference call between vet and patient
Messaging system to allow users to communicate in text form
Review system between users
Scheduling feature for users to meet.
Map view of clinic locations to help with selection
○       2-3 stretch requirements (plan to complete 1!)
Chat bot to provide instant answer to simple questions
Payment system
History and analytics on past performance
●        Pick 2 of your minimal requirements and break each of them down into ~2-5 smaller tasks!
Home page displaying menu option(login, sign-in, search)
Built HTML file for home web page 
Build CSS file for home web page 
Build JS for home web page
Instal a filter search feature
Sign-in form for users to create a profile

Allow access to next page if the account exist and the password matches

○        This will help you divide up work among your teammates
●        Finally, draw 2-3 rough sketch prototypes of some key tasks of your app. Sketch these physically on paper and then scan and add to your repo.
